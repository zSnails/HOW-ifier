# HOW-ifier (core)

This is intended to be used with the command line

What the actual fuck is this? Idek, my friends and I were messing around with images and I decided to make this lmfao

# Installation

* Install with npm.

```bash
$ npm i -g howifiercore
```

# What this can and can't do

* This can't edit photos, just fry them and add HOW at the top
* This can't HOWify multiple photos at the same time.
* This can give u some fun lol

# Example

First, type `how --config` to set up a saving path.
```bash
$ how --config
Provide the desired save path: <path here>
```
> if you're on window use / instead of \

> If you don't know what this is you better google it, bc I'm not telling u

Then you can use the `how` command.
```bash
$ how
```
Then, when the prompt appears you can enter a link to an image
```bash
$ how
Provide an url/path to the image that you want to HOW-ify <link here>
```
After you enter the link you can now press enter and it'll generate the image for you
```bash
$ how
Provide an url/path to the image that you want to HOW-ify 
Writing image (this may take a wile)
