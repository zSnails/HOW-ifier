# HOW-ifier (core)


> I fixed **most** of the bugs this shit had, but I'm not sure


This is intended to be used with the command line, if you want to use this on your Node.js program, check out [howifier](https://www.npmjs.com/package/howifier).

What the actual fuck is this? Idek, my friends and I were messing around with images and I decided to make this lmfao

# Installation

* Install with npm.

```bash
$ npm i -g howifiercore
```

# What this can and can't do

* This can't edit photos, just fry them and add HOW at the top
* This can't HOWify multiple photos at the same time.
* This can give u some fun lol

# Example

Run `how <Url|Path>`

Enjoy your image
