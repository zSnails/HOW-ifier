# HOW-ifier

What the actual fuck is this? Idek, my friends and I were messing around with images and I decided to make this lmfao

# Installation

* Clone the repo.

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/zSnails/HOW-ifier.git
```

If you're on linux remember to set the `start` file as an executable file, on windows just run the `start.bat` file.

When you run it it'll ask for either an url or the path to the file (you can use local files).

# What this can and can't do

* This can't edit photos, just fry them and add HOW at the top
* This can't HOWify multiple photos at the same time.
* This can give u some fun lol
